# Ardio
Ardio is a web application that converts CTV News articles into mp3 files. Currently, this only works for CTV, but in the future, I am planning on expanding it to more news soruces such as Global News or CNN. 

### Note:
This web app is currently still in progress, and has several bugs. 

Known errors
- 

Future Implementations:
- The ability to change the language of the article
- Expand to other news outlets such as) Global News, CNN, etc.
- Make the voice less robotic and more human like!
- Faster conversion times!
